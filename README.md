# WGPU 2D Pixel Art Proof of Concept
This was initially a repository for a game I was working on, however the slow compile times of Rust were enough motivation to stop using Rust to develop games. This repository now exists as a proof of concept for scaling pixel art properly even to non integer multiple resolutions of the base resolution.
